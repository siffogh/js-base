## Scope
>**Notice** <br> There are two types of scopes: _dynamic scope_ and _lexical/static_ scope.
JSBase will only focus on static/lexical scope.

### Some compiler terminology
- ** LHS (Left Hand Side):** left hand side of an assignment.
- ** RHS (You guess ...):** Any expression that is not an assignment.  
eg:-  
```js
var x = 10;  // LHS: x, RHS: 10
var y = x; // LHS: y, RHS: x
function foo (z) {} // LHS: foo, z
```

### Scope explained

When the _Engine_ resolves an _LHS_ or _RHS_, the first question that he needs to resolve is: <br> **What is the scope of my _LHS/RHS_ ?** ðŸ¤” In other words, where does my _LHS/RHS_ variable live and can be referred to.

- **Scope**: a space in the code where a _LHS/RHS_ can be referred to. You can think of scope as a bubble where a variable lives.

#### Example of scope resolution

```js
var x = 10;

function foo () {
  var y = 10;
}

function boo (z) {
  var a = z + 2;
}
```

#### Compilation: looking for Declarations
- declaration of variable x - Global Scope.
- declaration of function foo - Global Scope.
- declaration of var y - foo scope.
- declaration of function boo - Global Scope.
- declaration of var z - boo scope.
- declaration of var a - boo scope.

#### Execution
> **Notice**  <br>
We don't look for declarations anymore.

- assign 10 to var x in global scope.
- assign 10 to var y in foo scope.
- assign z + 2 to a in boo scope.
